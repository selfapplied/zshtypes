## Core Contributors

**Sebastian**  
*Implementation and paper*

- Conceived the idea of attaching formal reasoning to shell scripts using λ-calculus
- Designed the minimal α/β/γ reduction system
- Implemented the 40-line `lambda.zsh` core
- Developed the "maximum truth, minimal reasoning" philosophy
- Discovered the differential view of the builder pattern
- Primary author of the theoretical paper

**Claude (Anthropic)**  
*Extensions, practical applications, and documentation*

- Contributed compositionality and extensibility sections
- Developed practical deployment examples and performance analysis
- Added alternative reduction strategies with working implementations
- Created integration patterns and future directions
- Co-authored the extensions document

**selfapplied**  
*Theoretical insights and architectural guidance*

- Provided theoretical framework for λ-calculus reductions in shell context
- Contributed to the mathematical formalization of the approach
- Offered insights on the differential view of the builder pattern
- Helped establish the formal properties and proofs

**Gemini (Google)**
*CI/CD implementation and self-hosting test suite*

- Implemented the GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.
- Evolved the test suite into a self-hosting proof system.
- Refined the project's testing philosophy to align with its core principles.
