# A Minimal λ-Calculus Layer for Z-sh

## 1 Abstract
We present **`lambda.zsh`**, a 40-line shell library that lets ordinary
Z-shell scripts attach *formal reasoning* to the commands they run.
Every shell test or command is wrapped as a **labelled λ-term**.
A tiny *reducer* then performs α/β/γ reductions and collapses the whole
proof to **one single sentence** beginning with `∀`, `∃`, or `¬∃`.

The transformation always terminates, is continuous, and – once the
λ-terms are defined – is immune to code-injection.  Its time complexity
is `O(n log n)`, dominated by a single sort that yields a canonical
order of evidence labels.

## 2 The Engine in One Glance

```zsh
lp TEST LABEL   # ⇒ predicate   λ?  (returns status of TEST)
la CMD  LABEL   # ⇒ action      λ!  (runs CMD)
r  p? … -- a! … # ⇒ reducer → "∀/∃/¬∃ label, …"
```

Example
```zsh
source lambda.zsh
f=script.zsh; dst=/tmp
px=$(lp '[[ -x $f ]]'   '-x✓')
pw=$(lp '[[ -w $dst ]]' 'w✓')
cp=$(la 'cp $f $dst'    'copied')

r $px $pw -- $cp   # ⇒  ∀ -x✓,w✓,copied
```

## 3 Reductions Supported

1. **α (renaming).**  Each λ receives a fresh internal name `_λN`; capture
   is impossible.
2. **β (application).**  Occurs when the reducer invokes the generated
   function.
3. **γ (normalisation).**  After all β-steps the reducer sorts the list of
   evidence labels.  This gives a unique canonical form and costs
   `O(n log n)`.

---

## 4 Why It Always Halts

Let *n* be the number of tokens fed to `r` (predicates + actions).

1. **Predicate phase.**  A `while` loop executes `shift` once per token →
   ≤ *n* iterations.
2. **Action phase.**  A `for` loop over the remaining tokens → ≤ *n*
   iterations.
3. **No recursion.**  `r` never re-invokes itself.
4. **Finite β.**  Each λ is called *once* → ≤ *n* function calls.

Thus the reducer performs `Θ(n)` work before entering the `sort`, which
adds `O(n log n)`.  The overall transformation is therefore
`O(n log n)` and strongly normalising.

---

## 5 Security Considerations

*Construction layer.*  `lp` and `la` use `eval` exactly **once** to turn
literal source code into a function.  If the body and label are
hard-coded (or at least sanitised) this step is non-interactive and safe.

*Transformation layer.*  After construction the reducer performs *plain
function calls* — no further `eval`, no string-to-code conversion.  An
attacker cannot inject code via the evidence list.

Therefore **all injection risk is confined to definition-time, not
runtime**, and can be audited locally.

---

## 6 Continuity

Viewing the set of finite λ-term lists under prefix order forms a DCPO.
`r` is monotone and preserves least upper bounds (it never revokes a
decision once made), hence is **Scott-continuous**.  You may stream
terms indefinitely; once the output sentence stabilises it is final.

## 7 Gamma Gifts

If this tiny ghost finds the proof appetising, a virtual box of 🍫 will
suffice.  Blood sacrifices tend to gum up the keyboard.
